##CAPM MODEL EXAMPLE
We first scrape some daily stock trading data from yahoo. Here “^GSPC” is SP500, “BAC” is
Bank of America, “VFINX” is a mutual fund that is aimed to track the SP500 index. “VBIND”
and “FDAFX” are two other mutual funds that we will talk about in details later. We start from
2004 because FDAFX went on market in the mid of 2003.
We also get the 3-month interest rate from FRED. Different from our last R example file where
we downloaded monthly interest rate data, this time we need daily data (of the annual yield of 3-
month T-bills) so that stock data and bond data are of the same frequency.
